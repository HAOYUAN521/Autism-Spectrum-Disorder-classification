# Autism Spectrum Disorder classification: A study of using fused features based on deep learning models
This study proposes a novel feature fusion method to enhance the ASD classification performance by integrating the principal component features extracted by three dimensionality reduction techniques. The study evaluated the classification effects of three baseline deep learning models. The highest classification accuracy reached 80.2%. This proves that the use of fused features is meaningful.

## Description
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disease that mainly affects patients' social interaction, communication ability, and behavior patterns. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for intervention treatment, but existing diagnostic methods rely mainly on subjective evaluation. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides a powerful tool for objective classification of ASD by capturing the functional connectivity patterns of the brain. However, problems such as high-dimensional data, limited sample size and class imbalance restrict the improvement of model performance.

## Getting Started

### Data Load
The fMRI data for ASD subjects were sourced from the Preprocessed Connectomes Project (PCP)(http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.org/)
